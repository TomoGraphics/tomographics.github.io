We do microtomography and also offer microtomographic services.

Most easily we can provide tomographic scans done on a [SkyScan 1272][1272] and [SkyScan 1172][1172] from [Bruker].

We also worked at the [TOMCAT] beamline of the [Swiss Light Source][SLS] at the [Paul Scherrer Institut][PSI] in Switzerland and with [Scanco] machines.
