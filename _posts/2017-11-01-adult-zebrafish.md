A 3D visualization of a tomographic scan of a zebrafish in native state (9 months old).
The zebrafish was scanned with an isotropic voxel size of 10 Âµm.
The total length of the zebrafish embryo is approximately 3 cm.

The data set was visualized using [ClearVolume](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3372) in [Fiji](http://fiji.sc).
