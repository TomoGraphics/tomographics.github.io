This friendly spider was bothering our secretary.
After a nice long bath in 70% Ethanol (scented with Iodine) it was scanned on our [SkyScan 1272](http://bruker-microct.com/products/1272.htm) with a source Voltage of 50 kV, a source current of 200 µA with camera and geometry settings leading to an isotropic voxel size of 21.7 µm.
The *body* of the spider is approximately 1.2 cm long.

The visualization was made in [3D Slicer](http://slicer.org).
To simulate a shadow, we added a [MIP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_intensity_projection)-image (inverted, binarized and heavily blurred) of the spider to the visualization in addition to the 3D stack.
