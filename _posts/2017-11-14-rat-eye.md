The movie shows a 3D visualization of a tomographic scan of the eye of a 5 week old [Wistar rat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratory_rat#Wistar_rat).
The eye was instilled with [µAngiofil](http://www.micro-angio.ch/de/microangio) and scanned on a [SkyScan 1272](http://bruker-microct.com/products/1272.htm) with a source Voltage of 60 kV, a source current of 166 µA with camera and geometry settings leading isotropic voxel size of 1.25 µm.
The diameter of the eye is appproximately 5 mm.

The dataset was visualized in [3DSlicer](http://slicer.org), where we [exported the rotation as a set of single images](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/4.8/Modules/ScreenCapture).
This set of images was then converted to a movie with

````bash
cat *.png | avconv -f image2pipe -framerate 24 -i - -c:v h264 -b:v 5000k -preset veryslow -pix_fmt yuv420p -vf scale=-2:1080 output.mp4
````
The `output.mp4` movie was then converted to an auto-playing gif file with [this small bash script](https://github.com/thevangelist/FFMPEG-gif-script-for-bash).
