![zebrafish-embryo](/assets/2017/10/20/danio-rerio-embryo/ZebraFish.png)

A 3D visualization of a tomographic scan of a stained zebrafish embryo (44h old).

The embryo was scanned on a [SkyScan 1272](https://www.bruker.com/products/microtomography/micro-ct-for-sample-scanning/skyscan-1272/overview.html) with a source voltage of 60 kV, a source current of 166 µA with camera and geometry settings leading to an isotropic voxel size of 3 µm.
The total length of the zebrafish embryo is  2.7 mm.

The visualization was made with [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/).
