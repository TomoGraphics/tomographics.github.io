A 3D visualization of a tomographic scan of a stained zebrafish embryos (44h old).

The embryp was scanned on a [SkyScan 1272](http://bruker-microct.com/products/1272.htm) with a source Voltage of 60 kV, a source current of 166 µA with camera and geometry settings leading to an isotropic voxel size of 3 µm.
The total length of the zebrafish embryo is  2.7 mm.

The visualization was done in [3D Slicer](https://www.slicer.org/).
