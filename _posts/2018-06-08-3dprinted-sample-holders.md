We [recently presented a poster](/http://www.bruker-microct.com/company/usersmeeting2018.htm) with a fun thing from our lab; Since we often scan samples that are to be kept in a humid environment and have vastly different sizes we printed ourselves some custom-made sample holders on our [3D printer](https://formlabs.com/3d-printers/form-2/).

The sample holders have been whipped up in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) which is well suited to generate them in a relatively quick way.

Since we think that other people might be able to use them, we put a **complete** copy of all our sample holders up on GitHub.
You can download the OpenSCAD files for your perusal (e.g. edit them for your needs) by cloning the repository at [`https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs`](https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs).
Or you can just grab a copy of the STL files to directly print them, after having looked at them in the [3D viewer over at GitHub](https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs/blob/master/STL/Mouse.Melanoma.Multiple.stl).

Any contributors to the repository are very welcome, as specified [directly in the repository](https://github.com/TomoGraphics/Hol3Drs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) (and based on the awesome initiative [here](http://contributionswelcome.org/)).
