In a new project we scan mouse lungs in which tumors were induced.
The lung was critically-point-dried and scanned it on a [SkyScan 1272](https://www.bruker.com/products/microtomography/micro-ct-for-sample-scanning/skyscan-1272/overview.html) with a source Voltage of 50 kV, a source current of 200 µA with camera and geometry settings leading to an isotropic voxel size of 8 µm.
The whole scan took about 53 minutes.
The tumor is visible in the lower part of the left lung lobe and has a size of approximately 2 mm.

The data set was visualized in [CTVox](https://www.bruker.com/products/microtomography/micro-ct-software/3dsuite.html) and exported to a set of images.
We manually removed some cruft in the images and generated a movie [as described before]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-11-14-rat-eye %}).
